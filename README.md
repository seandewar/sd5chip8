# SD5 Chip-8
_(This project is currently a work in progress.)_

SD5 Chip-8 is an emulator/interpreter written in C++14 (using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013) for Chip-8 programs.

SD5 Chip-8 uses SFML 2.3.2 (https://github.com/SFML/SFML) for graphics and sound. Development of the project was made possible because of Cowgod's awesome Chip-8 technical reference (http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)!

_Project authored by Sean Dewar, 2015._

### Current program support

SD5 Chip-8 currently supports your typical Chip-8 programs, VIP 2-page hi-res programs and has partial support for ETI-660 programs.
